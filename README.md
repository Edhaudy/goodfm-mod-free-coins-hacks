GoodFM Mod 19000 free coins Hacks unlock all premium books - You can use artifacts on the battlefield to assist your heroes, and each artifact will give you an ultimate skill like a hero. Exchange artifacts to change your spells to fit your team. You can unlock more artifacts through the main storyline. Cultural relics can be upgraded by spending gold. The level of the artifact not only affects its spell strength, but also increases the passive gain it gives to the hero. Due to the fact that the troops will attack the nearest enemy, your enemy will also do the same. Therefore, it is a good idea to spread your team across multiple levels (unless you have an all-around tank). The next thing you should remember when building a formation is the class of a unit. Ideally, your front line should be reserved for bulky heroes, such as warriors and tanks.
